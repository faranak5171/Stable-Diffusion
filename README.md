**Image synthesis** is one of the computer vision fields with the most spectacular recent development, but also among those with the greatest computational demands.

Recently,**diffusion models**, which are built from a hierarchy of denoising autoencoders, have shown to achieve impressive results in image synthesis and beyond and define the state-of-the-art in class-conditional image synthesi and super-resolution.

Diffusion Models are probabilistic models designed to learn a data distribution p(x) by gradually **denoising** a normally distributed variable, which corresponds to learning the reverse process of a fixed Markov Chain of length T.
